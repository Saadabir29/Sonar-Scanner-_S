To run this codes, you need to follow these steps below -
1. Download Arduino IDE and Precessing Softwares.
2. Copy the code from radar.ino or open the file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Copy the code from Sonar.pde or open the file in the Processing software.

I'll share the circuit diagram in the near future. If you want the circuit diagram, email me in "siabiruchiha@gmail.com" .
